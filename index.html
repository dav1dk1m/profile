         <h5>Configuration Analyst | Software Engineer (E.I.T., APEGS)</h5>
         <p>
           I am a <strong>Configuration Analyst</strong> with a <strong>Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Systems Engineering (Distinction)</strong> 
           from the University of Regina and am a certified <strong>Engineer-in-Training (E.I.T.)</strong> under <strong>APEGS</strong> (Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Saskatchewan).  
           
           With a solid foundation as a <strong>software engineer and developer</strong>, I bring expertise in designing, developing, and optimizing 
           software solutions, as well as automating workflows to improve efficiency.  

           My professional experience spans both hands-on development and configuration in enterprise systems, where I have delivered 
           impactful solutions by combining technical knowledge, analytical skills, and collaborative teamwork.
