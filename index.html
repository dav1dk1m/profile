         <h5>Aspiring Software Systems Engineer</h5>
         <p>
           I am currently in my final semester at the University of Regina, completing my degree in 
           <strong>Software Systems Engineering</strong>. Over the course of my academic journey, 
           I have cultivated a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical software development. 

           Through my co-op work experiences as a <strong>Software Developer</strong>, I have contributed 
           to real-world projectsâ€”gaining hands-on skills in coding, debugging, and collaborating 
           within diverse teams. 

           Now, I am actively seeking a <strong>full-time position</strong> where I can apply my passion for 
           problem-solving to design and implement impactful software solutions. I look forward to 
           joining a dynamic environment that challenges and nurtures my continued growth in the tech field.
